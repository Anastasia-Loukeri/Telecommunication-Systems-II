# Telecommunication-Systems-II
In this research project,we explored the impact of radar interference on communication systems,an increasingly relevant topic in modern wireless networks.We focused on Section II of the following attached paper (reproduction of simulation results),which examines the effect of radar interference on a single-carrier communication system
